## Description  
"My-zootopia-api" is a simple Python script that fetches animal data from an external API and generates an HTML file listing animals with basic details (e.g. diet, location, type). The user types the name of an animal — if data is found, the script produces `animals.html`, which can be opened in a browser to view the results.

## Requirements / Dependencies

- Python 3.x  
- API Key from the service — you must get your API key from **api.ninjas.com**.  
- Python packages:  
  - `requests` (for HTTP requests)  
  - `json` (standard Python library)

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone this repository or copy the files to your local folder.  
2. Install required packages by running:  
   ```bash
   pip install requests
